      "NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this \n",
      "\"Annual Report\"), the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"NIKE\" and the \"Company\" refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries \n",
      "and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise.\n",
      "Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear , apparel, \n",
      "equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products \n",
      "through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms \n",
      "(also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales \n",
      "representatives in nearly all countries around the world. We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences through our \n",
      "digital platforms. Nearly all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel \n",
      "products are manufactured outside the United States, while equipment products are manufactured both in the United States and \n",
      "abroad.\n",
      "All references to fiscal 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are to NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal years ended May 31, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020, \n",
      "respectively. Any references to other fiscal years refer to a fiscal year ending on May 31 of that year.\n",
      "PRODUCTS\n",
      "Our NIKE Brand product offerings are aligned around our consumer construct focused on Men's, Women's and Kids'. We also \n",
      "design products specifically for the Jordan Brand and Converse. We believe this approach allows us to create products that \n",
      "better meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth opportunities.\n",
      "NIKE's athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are \n",
      "worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the \n",
      "development and manufacturing of our products. Our Men's, Women's and Jordan Brand footwear products currently lead in \n",
      "footwear sales and we expect them to continue to do so.\n",
      "We also sell sports apparel, which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and \n",
      "distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for \n",
      "athletic use, although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes, and demonstrates our commitment to \n",
      "innovation and high-quality construction. Our Men's and Women's apparel products currently lead in apparel sales and we expect \n",
      "them to continue to do so. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in \"collections\" of similar use or by category. We \n",
      "also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos.\n",
      "We sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, \n",
      "eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We \n",
      "also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary , NIKE IHM, Inc., \n",
      "doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.\n",
      "Our Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused \n",
      "on basketball performance and culture using the Jumpman trademark. S ales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are \n",
      "reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments.\n",
      "Our wholly-owned subsidiary brand, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses \n",
      "casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell \n",
      "trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n",
      "In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIK E Direct operations, we \n",
      "have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, \n",
      "certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities.\n",
      "2023 FORM 10-K   1    We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences as well as digital products through our digital platforms, including \n",
      "fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and wellness content; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the \n",
      "consumer experience.\n",
      "SALES AND MARKETING\n",
      "We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth \n",
      "fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters.  However, the mix of product sales may vary \n",
      "considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear , apparel and equipment, \n",
      "as well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors.\n",
      "Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as \n",
      "well as changing design trends, affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer \n",
      "preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing \n",
      "sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a \n",
      "material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n",
      "OUR MARKETS\n",
      "We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment \n",
      "operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear , apparel and \n",
      "equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa \n",
      "(\"EMEA\"); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (\"APLA\"), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands. Sales \n",
      "through our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.\n",
      "Converse is also a reportable operating segment and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing \n",
      "and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse direct to consumer operations, including digital commerce, \n",
      "are reported within the Converse operating segment results.\n",
      "UNITED STATES MARKET\n",
      "For fiscal 2023, NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 43% of total revenues, \n",
      "compared to 40% and 39% for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. We sell our products to thousands of retail accounts in \n",
      "the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, \n",
      "tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United S tates, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales. During \n",
